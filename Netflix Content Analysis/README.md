# Netflix Content Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about content distribution, genres, release trends, and regional contributions. The goal is to visualize patterns and provide actionable insights into Netflix’s content library.

## 🧩 Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Import dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`).
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Standardize categorical variables (e.g., genre, country).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**
   - Distribution of movies vs TV shows.
   - Top genres and their frequency.
   - Content release trends over time.
   - Country-wise content production.
   - Duration analysis (movies in minutes, TV shows in seasons).

3. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts for genre distribution.
   - Line plots for release trends.
   - Heatmaps for country contributions.
   - Pie charts for movies vs TV shows.

4. **Insights**
   - Netflix has a higher proportion of movies compared to TV shows.
   - Drama and Comedy are the most common genres.
   - Content production has increased significantly after 2015.
   - The United States and India are among the top contributors to Netflix’s library.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: Netflix Titles (Kaggle)

## 📊 Deliverables
- Jupyter notebook with full analysis.
- Visualizations highlighting key trends.
- Summary of insights for business understanding.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression to classify popular vs non-popular titles).
- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI or Streamlit).
- Compare Netflix content trends with competitors (Amazon Prime, Disney+).
